This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3033](http://localhost:3033) in your browser.

# Wishful

Create a wishful group with your friends, family, colleagues, or anyone.

Each person has the option to fill out a short survey with information about themselves, and to add a wishlist (with links).

When someone in the group buys something from someone else's wishlist, everyone in the group _EXCEPT THE RECIPIENT_ will see that someone has purchased that item, helping to avoid unintentional duplicate gifting. The recipient will be none the wiser.

The group organizer has the option of making the group a "secret-santa" group. This assigns each person in the group another member of the group to give a gift. No one (including the group organizer) can see who anyone is getting a gift for, except for themselves. The group organizer can specify if there are any people who should not be chosen for any other people, if need be.
